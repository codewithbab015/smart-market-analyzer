## **Market Analysis Agent**

### **Overview**

The **Market Analysis Agent** is an AI tool that helps users find the best products online. It takes a user’s search request and turns it into clear product suggestions by collecting and analysing data from online shops.

### **Goal**

To build a smart system that can:

1. Understand what the user wants.
2. Find product data from online stores.
3. Rank products by quality, popularity, and price.
4. Show the best 3 products with short, clear reasons.

### **How It Works**

The system has **four AI agents** that work one after another:

1. **Query Clarifier** – Understands what the user means.
2. **Category Mapper** – Decides where and how to look for products.
3. **Crawl Orchestrator** – Collects real product data from websites.
4. **Results Refiner** – Filters, ranks, and shows the best results.

**Process:**
User → Query Clarifier → Category Mapper → Crawl Orchestrator → Results Refiner → Final Results
